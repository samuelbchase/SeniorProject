\caption{Creating a spanning tree on a graph with per-vertex degree constraints}

    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State Graph $G(V,E)$ with a total degree of 2n-2 where n is the magnitude of $V$
    \State T = $\emptyset$
    \State T += ($v1$,$v2$) where $v1$ is the vertex of largest degree in V, and $v2$ is the vertex of second largest degree. Decrement the degree of $v1$ and $v2$
    \While{There exits a vertex in $V$ and $T$ with a degree $>$ 0 }
        \State {T+= ($t$,$v$) where $t$ is the vertex of largest degree in $t$, and $v$ is the largest vertex in $V$\textbackslash$T$}
